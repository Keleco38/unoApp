    There is some difference between this version of the game and the original. Here are the basics. (this only applies if the game mode
    selected is "special wild cards", if the selected mode is "normal" then the standard rules apply)
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first player that runs out of card is a round winner. Host can change the number of rounds required to win the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the player has played a card, and as a result of that they are left with 1 card in his hand, they must call "uno", by pressing
        the blue button in the middle of the screen. If the player doesn't call uno, they are punished by drawing 2 cards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can only play a card if it's their turn to play (excluding steal turn card, or if the game option "matching card steals turn" is on).
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can play colored card only if the color or the value on the card corresponds to the color or the value of the previously
        played card.
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can play steal turn card anytime if the color of the steal turn card corresponds to the previously played card.
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can play positive, neutral and gambling wildcards regardless of the previously played card (if not setup differently during the setup menu "Wild card can be played only as the last option"). Wildcards allow player to pick
        desired color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can play negative wildcards only under certain condition (read card section below). If the condition is fulfilled then the
        player can pick desired color.
      </li>
      <li>Cards that are automatically played do not require action from the player (read card section below)</li>
    </ul>
